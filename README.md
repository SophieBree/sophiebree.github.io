## Goals
What information I want to convey to someone looking at my portfolio is:
 - my name
 - where to contact me
 - my skills
 - some information about who I am personally
 - what kind of person I am
 - some projects I've done

## Features
I've used a single-page layout, so all the information you need is on one page only, with a couple of navigation menu links on the top right to help you scroll to what you care about most. The portfolio site also has an optimised layout for mobile so it can be viewed properly on any device.

### Navigation
As I mentioned, for navigation on desktop I have a simple navigation menu fixed to the top-right of the screen so that a person viewing my portfolio can easily scroll down to the projects I've done, or scroll back up to the top of the page.

### Intro/Contact
I have an introductory message with my name and my skillset (full-stack web developer) that is animated to slide in from the left when you first load the site. Below this are my 3 major links (Github, Twitter, LinkedIn), and below that is a small description of who I am in a work capacity.

### Skills
A list of my skills is displayed in a way to make it look like an object made of 3 arrays. The arrays are skills that I felt were appropriate to group together - the MERN stack, core front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JS), and extras (Git, Jest).

### About Me
A couple of paragraphs expanding a little on who I am in a work capacity, and also who I am personally.

### Projects
A grid of 4 of my projects that I've completed previously. Each project has a link to the Github repository and a link to see the website hosted live next to the title. Each project also includes a thumbnail picture of what it is, and a description underneath with some information about the project.
